    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>...</t>

      <t>It is a goal of this specification to provide sufficient metadata
      about an activity such that a consumer of the data can present it to a
      user in a rich human-friendly format. This may include constructing
      readable sentences about the activity that occurred, visual
      representations of the activity, or combining similar activities for
      display.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Notational Conventions">
      <t>This specification allows the use of IRIs <xref
      target="RFC3987"></xref>. Every URI <xref target="RFC3986"></xref> is
      also an IRI, so a URI may be used wherever an IRI is named. When an IRI
      that is not also a URI is given for dereferencing, it MUST be mapped to
      a URI using the steps in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC3987"></xref>.
      When an IRI is serving as an identifier, it MUST NOT be so mapped.</t>

      <t>The text of this specification provides the sole definition of
      conformance. Examples in this specification are non-normative.</t>

      <t>...</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="concepts" title="Activity Concepts">
      <t>In its simplest form, an activity consists of an actor, a verb, and
      an object. It tells the story of a person performing an action on or
      with an object -- "Geraldine posted a photo" or "John shared a video".
      In most cases these elements will be explicitly declared, but they may
      also be implied.</t>

      <section anchor="activity" title="The Activity Construct">
        <t>An activity consists of the following logical components:</t>

        <section anchor="activity.icon" title="Icon">
          <t>This URI value identifies an image resource which provides a
          visual representation of the activity, intended for human
          consumption. The image SHOULD be square and SHOULD be suitable for
          presentation at a small size. An Activity construct MAY have an icon
          but it MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.time" title="Time">
          <t>A Date Construct that identifies the time at which the activity
          occurred. It is important to note that this is not necessarily the
          same as the time at which the activity was published. An Activity
          construct MUST have exactly one Time value.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.actor" title="Actor">
          <t>An <xref target="object">Object Construct</xref> that identifies
          the entity that performed the activity. An Activity construct MUST
          have exactly one actor.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.verb" title="Verb">
          <t>An absolute URI value that identifies the action of the activity.
          An Activity construct MUST have one or more verbs.</t>

          <t>If an activity contains more than one verb, all verbs MUST be
          generalizations or specializations of one another. For example, the
          general verb "to experience" might be specialized by a verb "to
          listen to". If a more specific verb is used, publishers SHOULD also
          include all of its more general verbs so that a consumer may use the
          most specific verb it understands.</t>

          <t>An activity consumer SHOULD use the most specific verb it
          understands within each entry. If none of the activity's verbs are
          understood by the consumer, it MAY use other information to infer
          the verb, or the consumer MAY use the content of the activity title,
          summary and/or content to obtain a human-readable description of the
          activity.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.object" title="Object">
          <t>This <xref target="object">Object Construct</xref> identifies the
          primary object of the activity. An Activity construct MUST have
          exactly one object.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.target" title="Target">
          <t>The target of an activity is an <xref target="object">Object
          Construct</xref> that represents the object to which the activity
          was performed. The exact meaning of an activity's target is
          dependent on the verb of the activity, but will often be the object
          of the English preposition "to". For example, in the activity "John
          saved a movie to his wishlist", the target of the activity is
          'wishlist'. The activity target MUST NOT be used to identify an
          indirect object that is not a target of the activity. An Activity
          construct MAY have a target but it MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.generator" title="Generator">
          <t>The generator of an activity is an <xref target="object">Object
          Construct</xref> that represents the application which created it,
          which may be separate from the service to which the activity is
          published. For example, a third-party application on a mobile phone
          may be used to post a photo to a photo sharing service. The activity
          generator is identified by a name and optional URI. An Activity
          construct MAY have a generator but it MUST NOT have more than
          one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.provider" title="Service Provider">
          <t>The service provider of an activity is an <xref
          target="object">Object Construct</xref> that represents the service
          which is publishing the activity. An Activity Construct MAY have a
          provider but it MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.title" title="Title">
          <t>An HTML representation of the natural language title for this
          activity. Consumers MAY use the value of this field, if set, as a
          fallback for when none of the provided verbs are recognized. An
          Activity Construct MAY have a title but it MUST NOT have more than
          one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.body" title="Body">
          <t>An HTML representation of a natural language describing this
          activity including visual elements such as thumbnails. Consumers MAY
          use the value of this field, if set, as a fallback for when none of
          the provided verbs are recognized. An Activity Construct MAY have a
          body but it MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="object" title="The Object Construct">
        <t>An object construct is a thing, real or imaginary, which
        participates in an activity. It may be the entity performing the
        activity, or the entity on which the activity was performed. An object
        consists of the logical components defined in the following sections.
        Certain object types may further refine the meaning of these
        components, or they may define additional components. If an object
        type defines an additional component then it SHOULD also define the
        representation of that component in one or more serialization
        formats.</t>

        <section anchor="object.id" title="ID">
          <t>The id of an object construct is an absolute URI that uniquely
          identifies the object. An Object construct SHOULD have exactly one
          ID value. If an object construct does not have an ID value consumers
          MAY use the Permalink URL as a weaker identifier, but must in this
          case allow for the fact that Permalink URL is not defined to be
          unique across all objects and be prepared to handle duplicates.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.name" title="Name">
          <t>This string value provides a human readable display name for the
          object, if the object has a name. An Object construct MAY have a
          name, but MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.summary" title="Summary">
          <t>This string value provides a human readable description or
          summary of the Object. An Object construct MAY have a summary, but
          MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.image" title="Representative Image">
          <t>A <xref target="medialink">Media Link Construct</xref> that
          identifies an image resource which provides a visual representation
          of the object, intended for human consumption. An Object construct
          MAY have a representative image, but MUST NOT have more than
          one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.permalink" title="Permalink URL">
          <t>This URI value identifies a resource which provides an HTML
          representation of the object. An Object construct MAY have a
          Permalink URL, but MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.object-type" title="Object Type">
          <t>This absolute URI identifies the type of object. An Object
          construct MAY have one or more types.</t>

          <t>If an object contains more than one object type, all types MUST
          be generalizations or specializations of one another. For example,
          the general type "article" might be specialized by the type "weblog
          entry". If a more specific type is used, publishers SHOULD also
          include all of its more general types so that a consumer may use the
          most specific type it understands.</t>

          <t>Activity consumers SHOULD use the most specific object type that
          they understand within each entry. The consumer MAY use other
          information to infer the object type if it does not recognize any of
          the object types given. If it cannot infer the object type, a
          consumer MUST act as though no object type is present.</t>

          <t>If no object type is present, the object has no specific type.
          Consumers SHOULD refer to such objects only by their names. For
          example, when forming an activity sentence a consumer might say
          "Johan posted 'My Cat'" rather than "Johan posted a photo: 'My
          Cat'".</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.in-reply-to-object" title="In Reply To Object">
          <t>An <xref target="object">Object Construct</xref> that this object
          is a response to. An Object Construct MAY have one In Reply To
          Object, but MUST NOT have more than one.</t>

          <t>This is not set unless the Object Construct is a response to
          another Object Construct.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.attached-object" title="Attached Object">
          <t>An <xref target="object">Object Construct</xref> that is attached
          to this object. An Object Construct MAY have one or more attached
          objects.</t>

          <t>An attached Object Construct can be used when one object is used
          as a wrapper or carrier for another object, similar to the concept
          of attached files in an email message.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.reply" title="Reply Object">
          <t>An <xref target="object">Object Construct</xref> that has this
          Object Construct as its In Reply To Object. An Object Construct MAY
          have one more more Reply Objects.</t>

          <t>In many cases a specific publication of an object will include
          only a selection of the full set of objects posted as replies to
          this object. Publishers MAY choose any subset of the set of all
          reply objects to include. Publishers MAY make available a complete
          list of reply objects for a particular object via a separate
          mechanism, but that mechanism is not defined by this
          specification.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.reaction" title="Reaction Activity">
          <t>An <xref target="activity">Activity Construct</xref> that
          describes an Activity whose Object is this Object Construct. An
          Object Construct MAY have one or more Reaction Activities.</t>

          <t>In many cases a specific publication of an object will include
          only a selection of the full set of activities that are reactions to
          this object. Publishers MAY choose any subset of the set of all
          reaction activities to include. Publishers MAY make available a
          complete list of reaction activities for a particular object via a
          separate mechanism, but that mechanism is not defined by this
          specification.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.action-link" title="Action Link">
          <t>An <xref target="actionlink">Action Link</xref> that represents
          an action that a human could peform on this object. An Object
          Construct MAY have one or more Action Links.</t>

      two representations are semantically equivalent. If a property is having
      a value whose type is a JSON array, the absense of any items in that

    <section anchor="post-verb" title="The &quot;Post&quot; Verb">
      <t>This specificiation defines one initial verb and defers to other
      specifications to define the full schema of verb and object types as
      defined in <xref target="extensions"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The "Post" verb describes the act of authoring an object and then
      publishing it online. The verb URI for the "Post" verb is <spanx
      style="verb">http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/post</spanx>.</t>

      <t>The actor of an Activity Construct using the "Post" verb is an Object
      Construct representing the person or object that authored and posted the
      item represented by the object of the Activity Construct.</t>

      <t>The target of the Activity Construct, if present, represents the item
      into which the object is posted. For example, this could represent a
      blog that the author has posted in.</t>

      <t>It is not appropriate to use the target of the Activity Construct to
      represent an Object Construct that this new Object Construct is posted
      in reply to. Instead, this SHOULD be represented as the In Reply To
      Object component of the new object.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="extensions" title="Extension Object Types and Verbs">
      <t>Other specifications MAY define new object types and verbs for use
      with the concepts and serializations defined in this specification.</t>

      <t>When defining a new verb, the defining specification MUST provide a
      verb identifier URI for the new verb and MUST define the meaning of the
      verb in terms of the Actor, Object and Target components of the Activity
      Construct, and MUST define whether a Target is required and what it
      represents when present.</t>

      <t>When defining a new object type, the defining specification MUST
      provide an object type identifier URI for the new object type. The
      definition of the new object type MAY define additional components
      specific to that object type; if so, the specification SHOULD define how
      these additional components are to be represented as JSON properties,
      and the specification MAY define how these additional components are to
      be represented in other serialization formats. The definition of the new
      object type MAY impose additional meaning or constraint on the core
      Object Construct components as long as the new definition remains
      compatible with the definition of the base component. New Object
      Construct components SHOULD be defined such that the object would remain
      useful if those components are omitted or removed during processing, to
      enable graceful fallback by consumers that do not implement the
      extension components or alternative representations that are unable to
      represent the extensions.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="other-serializations" title="Other Serialization Formats">
      <t>This specification defines the primary representation for the
      Activity Streams concepts in terms of the JSON serialization format.
      Other specifications MAY define additional representations of the
      Activity Streams concepts. If the new representation is compatible with
      the JSON data model, the new representation SHOULD be defined as a
      transformation of the raw JSON structures. Otherwise, the new
      representation MAY be defined in terms of the Activity Streams concepts
      in <xref target="concepts"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Defining a new representation as a transformation from JSON will
      allow the new representation to automatically support additional
      components added for new object types as described in <xref
      target="extensions"></xref>. Otherwise the representation of these new
      components must be defined on a case-by-case basis.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Publishers or Consumers implementing Activity Streams as a stream of
      public data may also want to consider the potential for unsolicited
      commercial or malicious content and should take preventative measures to
      recognize such content and either identify it or not include it in their
      stream implementations.</t>

      <t>Publishers should take reasonable measures to make sure potentially
      malicious user input such as cross-site scripting attacks are not
      included in the Activity Streams data they publish.</t>

      <t>Consumers that re-emit ingested content to end-users MUST take
      reasonable measures if emitting ingested content to make sure
      potentially malicious ingested input is not re-emitted.</t>

      <t>Consumers that re-emit ingested content for crawling by search
      engines should take reasonable measures to limit any use of their site
      as a Search Engine Optimization loophole. This may include converting
      un-trusted hyperlinks to text or including a rel="nofollow"
      attribute.</t>
