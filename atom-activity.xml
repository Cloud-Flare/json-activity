    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Atom Syndication Format, as defined in <xref
      target="RFC4287"></xref>, is widely used to transmit various types of
      web content such as weblog posts, news headlines, as well as user
      activities within social sites. In the case of user activities, Atom
      lacks the ability to express much of the activity-specific metadata in a
      machine-parseable format. Activity Streams is an XML format designed to
      allow this additional activity metadata to be expressed within existing
      Atom entries and feeds.</t>

      <t>It is a goal of this specification to provide sufficient metadata
      about an activity such that a consumer of the data can present it to a
      user in a rich human-friendly format. This may include constructing
      readable sentences about the activity that occurred, visual
      representations of the activity, or combining similar activities for
      display.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Notational Conventions">
      <t>The XML Namespaces URI [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114] for the XML
      elements and attributes described in this specification is: <spanx
      style="verb">http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/</spanx>.</t>

      <t>In this document, this namespace is referred to as "the AtomActivity
      namespace", and the namespace prefix "activity:" is used for the above
      namespace URI. The namespace prefix "atom:" is used for the namespace
      URI <spanx style="verb">http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom</spanx>. The
      namespace prefix "thr:" is used for the namespace URI <spanx
      style="verb">http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0</spanx>. The choices
      of namespace prefix are arbitrary and not semantically significant.</t>

      <t>This specification uses a shorthand form of terms from the XML
      Infoset [W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20040204]. The phrase "Information Item" is
      omitted when naming element and attribute information items. Therefore,
      when this specification uses the term "element," it is referring to an
      element information item in infoset terms. Likewise, when this
      specification uses the term "attribute," it is referring to an attribute
      information item.</t>

      <t>This specification allows the use of IRIs [RFC3987]. Every URI
      [RFC3986] is also an IRI, so a URI may be used wherever an IRI is named.
      When an IRI that is not also a URI is given for dereferencing, it MUST
      be mapped to a URI using the steps in Section 3.1 of [RFC3987]. When an
      IRI is serving as an identifier, it MUST NOT be so mapped.</t>

      <t>The text of this specification provides the sole definition of
      conformance. Examples in this specification are non-normative.</t>

      <t>This specification uses "the Atom specification" to refer to <xref
      target="RFC4287"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="concepts" title="Activity Concepts">
      <t>In its simplest form, an activity consists of an actor, a verb, and
      an object. It tells the story of a person performing an action on or
      with an object -- "Geraldine posted an photo" or "John shared a video".
      In most cases these elements will be explicitly declared, but they may
      also be implied.</t>

      <section anchor="Activity" title="The Activity Construct">
        <t>An activity consists of the following logical components:</t>

        <section anchor="Activity-Id" title="ID">
          <t>This absolute URI value conveys a permanent, universally
          unique identifier for the activity.  An Activity construct MUST have
          exactly one ID value.</t>

          <t>(TODO: Still some question as to whether this should be part of
          the Activity construct, rather than just part of the Atom
          representation)</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="Activity-Time" title="Time">
          <t>A [Date Construct] that identifies the time at which the activity
          occurred. It is important to note that this is not necessarily the
          same as the time at which the activity was published.  An Activity
          construct MUST have exactly one Time value.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="Activity-Actor" title="Actor">
          <t>An [Object Construct] that identifies the entity that performed
          the activity.  An Activity construct MUST have exactly one actor.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="Activity-Verb" title="Verb">
          <t>An absolute URI value that identifies the action of the activity.
          An Activity construct MUST have at least one verb, and MAY have more
          than one.</t>

          <t>If an activity contains more than one verb, all verbs MUST be
          generalizations or specializations of one another. For example, the
          general verb "to experience" might be specialized by a verb "to
          listen to". If a more specific verb is used, publishers SHOULD also
          include all of its more general verbs so that a consumer may use the
          most specific verb it understands.</t>

          <t>An activity consumer SHOULD use the most specific verb it
          understands within each entry. If none of the activity's verbs are
          understood by the consumer, it MAY use other information to infer
          the verb, or the consumer MAY use the content of the activity title,
          summary and/or content to obtain a human-readable description of the
          activity.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="Activity-Object" title="Object">
          <t>This [Object Construct] identifies the primary object of the
          activity.  An Activity construct MUST have exactly one object.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="Activity-Target" title="Target">
          <t>The target of an activity is an [Object Construct] that
          represents the object to which the activity was performed. The exact
          meaning of an activity's target is dependent on the verb of the
          activity, but will often be the object of the English preposition
          "to". For example, in the activity "John saved a movie to his
          wishlist", the target of the activity is 'wishlist'. The activity
          target MUST NOT be used to identify an indirect object that is not a
          target of the activity.  An Activity construct MAY have a target, but
          MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="Activity-Generator" title="Generator">
          <t>The generator of an activity identifies that application which
          created it, which may be separate from the service to which the
          activity is published.  For example, a third-party application on a
          mobile phone may be used to post a photo to a photo sharing service.
          The activity generator is identified by a name and optional URI.
          An Activity construct MAY have a generator, but MUST NOT have more
          than one.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Object" title="The Object Construct">
        <t>An object construct is a thing, real or imaginary, which
        participates in an activity. It may be the entity performing the
        activity, or the entity on which the activity was performed. An object
        consists of the following logical components:</t>

        <section anchor="Object-Id" title="ID">
          <t>The id of an object construct is an absolute URI that uniquely
          identifies the object.  An Object construct MUST have exactly one
          ID value.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="Object-Name" title="Name">
          <t>This string value provides a human readable display name for the
          object, if the object has a name.  An Object construct MAY have a
          name, but MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="Object-Url" title="URL">
          <t>This URI value identifies an HTML representation of the
          object.  An Object construct MAY have a URL, but MUST NOT have more
          than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="Object-ObjectType" title="Object Type">
          <t>This absolute URI identifies the type of object.  An Object
          construct MAY have one or more types.</t>

          <t>If an object contains more than one object type, all types MUST be
          generalizations or specializations of one another. For example, the
          general type "article" might be specialized by the type "weblog
          entry". If a more specific type is used, publishers SHOULD also
          include all of its more general types so that a consumer may use the
          most specific type it understands.</t>

          <t>Activity consumers SHOULD use the most specific object type that
          they understand within each entry. The consumer MAY use other
          information to infer the object type if it does not recognize any of
          the object types given. If it cannot infer the object type, a
          consumer MUST act as though no object type is present.</t>

          <t>If no object type is present, the object has no specific type.
          Consumers SHOULD refer to such objects only by their titles. For
          example, when forming an activity sentence a consumer might say
          "Johan posted 'My Cat'" rather than "Johan posted a photo: 'My
          Cat'".</t>

    <section title="Atom Representation">
      <t>Activities are represented in an Atom document using a combination of
      conventions and custom extension elements. Activities are represented
      using atom:entry elements but may exist in one of two forms, an Activity
      Entry or an Object Entry.</t>

      <section anchor="activityasentry"
               title="Activity represented as atom:entry">
        <t>Any valid Atom entry as defined by section 4.1.2 of <xref
        target="RFC4287"></xref> is a representation of one or more activities
        as defined in <xref target="Activity"></xref>.</t>

        <t>If the atom:entry contains at least one activity:verb element and
        at least one activity:object element then it is a full activity entry
        and MUST be processed as described in <xref
        target="fullactivityentry"></xref>. Otherwise the entry is an implied
        activity shorthand entry and MUST be processed as described in <xref
        target="impliedactivityentry"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Although there is not a one-to-one mapping between an Atom entry
        and an activity, consumers SHOULD retain the value of the atom:id
        element from which each activity was produced such that these
        activities can be identified should an entry be referred to by another
        Atom feature which is not aware of the extensions defined in this
        specification. This id is not unique across all activities and has no
        semantic singificance for Activity Streams processing.</t>

        <section anchor="fullactivityentry" title="Full Activity Entry">
          <t>A full activity entry represents a selection of one or more
          activities which refer to different objects but all share the same
          values for the other activity properties.</t>

          <t>The atom:author element which applies to the entry, as defined by
          section 4.2.1 of <xref target="RFC4287"></xref>, represents the
          actor of the represented activities. This element MUST be processed
          into an object construct as defined in <xref
          target="objectasauthor"></xref>.</t>

          <t>If the entry element has as a direct child an activity:target
          element then this element represents the target of the represented
          activities. This element MUST be processed into an object construct
          as defined in <xref target="objectasobject"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The atom:published chlid element of the entry, as defined in
          section 4.2.9 of <xref target="RFC4287"></xref>, represents the time
          of the represented activities.</t>

          <t>Each activity:verb child element of the entry represents a verb
          for the represented activities.</t>

          <t>If the entry has as a direct child an atom:generator element then
          it MUST be processed as defined in section 4.2.4 of <xref
          target="RFC4287"></xref> and its name and URI used for the generator
          property of the represented activities.</t>

          <t>Each activity:object child element of the entry represents the
          object of an activity whose other properties are represented as
          described above. Each element MUST be processed into an object
          construct as defined in <xref target="objectasobject"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The set of activities represented by a full activity entry is the
          set of activities created by combining the object represented by
          each activity:object element with the other common properties.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="impliedactivityentry"
                 title="Implied Activity Shorthand">
          <t>An implied activity shorthand entry represents exactly one
          activity in terms of its object.</t>

          <t>The atom:published chlid element of the entry, as defined in
          section 4.2.9 of <xref target="RFC4287"></xref>, represents the time
          of the represented activity.</t>

          <t>If the entry has as direct children one or more activity:verb
          elements, each of these elements represents a verb for the
          represented activity. If the entry has no activity:verb child
          elements, the represented activity is implied to have only the
          "post" verb as defined in [TODO: write this section and xref].</t>

          <t>If the entry has as a direct child an atom:generator element then
          it MUST be processed as defined in section 4.2.4 of <xref
          target="RFC4287"></xref> and its name and URI used for the generator
          property of the represented activity.</t>

          <t>If the set of verbs for the represented activity includes the
          "post" verb, the atom:author element which applies to the entry, as
          defined by section 4.2.1 of <xref target="RFC4287"></xref>,
          represents the actor of the represented activity. If the set of
          verbs does not include the "post" verb then the containing atom:feed
          element MUST have an atom:author element as its direct child and
          this element represents the actor of the represented activity. This
          appropriate atom:author element MUST be processed into an object
          construct as defined in <xref target="objectasauthor"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The atom:entry element itself MUST also be processed into an
          object construct as defined in <xref target="objectasentry"></xref>
          and used as the object of the represented activity. If the set of
          verbs for the represented activity does not include the "post" verb
          then the atom:published child element MUST be ignored when doing
          this processing, because the date therein represents the date of the
          activity and not the publication date of the object.</t>

          <t>The represented activity of an implied activity shorthand entry
          does not have a target.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Object Representations">
        <t>Objects can be represented in a variety of forms depending on
        context. All of these representations encode the data model described
        for the object construct in <xref target="Object"></xref>. These
        representations are used in various contexts within the Atom
        representation of an activity as described in <xref

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>As this specification defines an extension to the Atom Syndication
      Format, it is subject to the same security considerations defined in
      <xref target="RFC4287"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Publishers or Consumers implementing Activity Streams as a stream of
      public data may also want to consider the potential for unsolicited
      commercial or malicious content and should take preventative measures to
      recognize such content and either identify it or not include it in their
      stream implementations.</t>

      <t>Publishers should take reasonable measures to make sure potentially
      malicious user input such as cross-site scripting attacks are not
      included in the Activity Streams data they publish.</t>

      <t>Consumers that re-emit ingested content to end-users MUST take

          <postamble>This example shows a typical activity entry using the
          post verb defined by this specification and a hypothetical "photo"
          object type. It also demonstrates the use of atom:title and
          atom:content to provide fallback content for feed processors that do
          not support activity extensions. An activity stream application
          might render this entry into the sentence "Geraldine posted a photo
          titled 'My Cat' in Geraldine's Photos", with the photo title and the
          source feed title presented as links.</postamble>

          <postamble>Example: An activity entry showing the use of the actor,
          verb, object and target elements. Also illustrated is the use of
          multiple objects in a single activity entry, which serves as a
          shorthand for publishing multiple consecutive activities with the
          same verb and target.</postamble>

          in the activity entry example.</postamble>
