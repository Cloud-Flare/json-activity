    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Atom Syndication Format, as defined in <xref
      target="RFC4287"></xref>, is widely used to transmit various types of
      web content such as weblog posts, news headlines, as well as user
      activities within social sites. In the case of user activities, Atom
      lacks the ability to express much of the activity-specific metadata in a
      machine-parseable format. Activity Streams is an XML format designed to
      allow this additional activity metadata to be expressed within existing
      Atom entries and feeds.</t>

      <t>It is a goal of this specification to provide sufficient metadata
      about an activity such that a consumer of the data can present it to a
      user in a rich human-friendly format. This may include constructing
      readable sentences about the activity that occurred, visual
      representations of the activity, or combining similar activities for
      display.</t>

    <section title="Notational Conventions">
      <t>This document refers to elements in a number of XML namespaces as
      defined in <xref target="xml-names"></xref>. For brevity, these elements
      shall be referred to using prefixes rather than their full namespace
      URIs. The aliases used within this document are listed in the following
      table. The choices of namespace prefix are arbitrary and are not
      semantically significant.</t>

      <t>This specification uses a shorthand form of terms from the XML
      Infoset <xref target="xml-infoset"></xref>. The phrase "Information
      Item" is omitted when naming element and attribute information items.
      Therefore, when this specification uses the term "element," it is
      referring to an element information item in infoset terms. Likewise,
      when this specification uses the term "attribute," it is referring to an
      attribute information item.</t>

      <t>This specification allows the use of IRIs <xref
      target="RFC3987"></xref>. Every URI <xref target="RFC3986"></xref> is
      also an IRI, so a URI may be used wherever an IRI is named. When an IRI
      that is not also a URI is given for dereferencing, it MUST be mapped to
      a URI using the steps in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC3987"></xref>.
      When an IRI is serving as an identifier, it MUST NOT be so mapped.</t>

      <t>The text of this specification provides the sole definition of
      conformance. Examples in this specification are non-normative.</t>

      <t>This specification uses "the Atom specification" to refer to <xref
      target="RFC4287"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="concepts" title="Activity Concepts">
      <t>In its simplest form, an activity consists of an actor, a verb, and
      an object. It tells the story of a person performing an action on or
      with an object -- "Geraldine posted a photo" or "John shared a video".
      In most cases these elements will be explicitly declared, but they may
      also be implied.</t>

      <section anchor="activity" title="The Activity Construct">
        <t>An activity consists of the following logical components:</t>

        <section anchor="activity.id" title="ID">
          <t>This absolute URI value conveys a permanent, universally unique
          identifier for the activity. An Activity construct MUST have exactly
          one ID value.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.icon" title="Icon">
          <t>This URI value identifies an image resource which provides a
          visual representation of the activity, intended for human
          consumption. The image SHOULD be square and SHOULD be suitable for
          presentation at a small size. An Activity construct MAY have zero or
          one icon.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.time" title="Time">
          <t>A Date Construct, as defined in section 3.3 of <xref
          target="RFC4287"></xref>, that identifies the time at which the
          activity occurred. It is important to note that this is not
          necessarily the same as the time at which the activity was
          published. An Activity construct MUST have exactly one Time
          value.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.actor" title="Actor">
          <t>An <xref target="object">Object Construct</xref> that identifies
          the entity that performed the activity. An Activity construct MUST
          have exactly one actor.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.verb" title="Verb">
          <t>An absolute URI value that identifies the action of the activity.
          An Activity construct MUST have one or more verbs.</t>

          <t>If an activity contains more than one verb, all verbs MUST be
          generalizations or specializations of one another. For example, the
          general verb "to experience" might be specialized by a verb "to
          listen to". If a more specific verb is used, publishers SHOULD also
          include all of its more general verbs so that a consumer may use the
          most specific verb it understands.</t>

          <t>An activity consumer SHOULD use the most specific verb it
          understands within each entry. If none of the activity's verbs are
          understood by the consumer, it MAY use other information to infer
          the verb, or the consumer MAY use the content of the activity title,
          summary and/or content to obtain a human-readable description of the
          activity.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.object" title="Object">
          <t>This <xref target="object">Object Construct</xref> identifies the
          primary object of the activity. An Activity construct MUST have
          exactly one object.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.target" title="Target">
          <t>The target of an activity is an <xref target="object">Object
          Construct</xref> that represents the object to which the activity
          was performed. The exact meaning of an activity's target is
          dependent on the verb of the activity, but will often be the object
          of the English preposition "to". For example, in the activity "John
          saved a movie to his wishlist", the target of the activity is
          'wishlist'. The activity target MUST NOT be used to identify an
          indirect object that is not a target of the activity. An Activity
          construct MAY have a zero or one target.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.generator" title="Generator">
          <t>The generator of an activity identifies that application which
          created it, which may be separate from the service to which the
          activity is published. For example, a third-party application on a
          mobile phone may be used to post a photo to a photo sharing service.
          The activity generator is identified by a name and optional URI. An
          Activity construct MAY have zero or one generator.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.permalink" title="Permalink URL">
          <t>The URL of a HTML page that represents this activity. This
          property SHOULD NOT be <spanx style="verb">null</spanx></t>

        <section anchor="activity.title" title="Title">
          <t>An HTML representation of the natural language title for this
          activity. Consumers MAY use the value of this field, if set, as a
          fallback for when none of the provided verbs are recognized. This
          property MAY be <spanx style="verb">null</spanx> if the publisher
          does not wish to provide a HTML representation.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="activity.body" title="Body">
          <t>An HTML representation of a natural language describing this
          activity including visual elements such as thumbnails. Consumers MAY
          use the value of this field, if set, as a fallback for when none of
          the provided verbs are recognized. This property MAY be <spanx
          style="verb">null</spanx> if the publisher does not wish to provide
          a HTML representation.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Privacy">

        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="object" title="The Object Construct">
        <t>An object construct is a thing, real or imaginary, which
        participates in an activity. It may be the entity performing the
        activity, or the entity on which the activity was performed. An object
        consists of the following logical components:</t>

        <section anchor="object.id" title="ID">
          <t>The id of an object construct is an absolute URI that uniquely
          identifies the object. An Object construct MUST have exactly one ID
          value.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.name" title="Name">
          <t>This string value provides a human readable display name for the
          object, if the object has a name. An Object construct MAY have a
          name, but MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.summary" title="Summary">
          <t>This string value provides a human readable description or
          summary of the Object. An Object construct MAY have a summary, but
          MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.image" title="Representative Image">
          <t>This URI value identifies an image resource which provides a
          visual representation of the object, intended for human consumption.
          An Object construct MAY have a image, but MUST NOT have more than
          one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.permalink" title="Permalink URL">
          <t>This URI value identifies a resource which provides an HTML
          representation of the object. An Object construct MAY have a
          Permalink URL, but MUST NOT have more than one.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="object.object-type" title="Object Type">
          <t>This absolute URI identifies the type of object. An Object
          construct MAY have one or more types.</t>

          <t>If an object contains more than one object type, all types MUST
          be generalizations or specializations of one another. For example,
          the general type "article" might be specialized by the type "weblog
          entry". If a more specific type is used, publishers SHOULD also
          include all of its more general types so that a consumer may use the
          most specific type it understands.</t>

          <t>Activity consumers SHOULD use the most specific object type that
          they understand within each entry. The consumer MAY use other
          information to infer the object type if it does not recognize any of
          the object types given. If it cannot infer the object type, a
          consumer MUST act as though no object type is present.</t>

          <t>If no object type is present, the object has no specific type.
          Consumers SHOULD refer to such objects only by their titles. For
          example, when forming an activity sentence a consumer might say
          "Johan posted 'My Cat'" rather than "Johan posted a photo: 'My
          Cat'".</t>

    <section title="Atom Representation">
      <t>Activities can be represented in an Atom document using a combination
      of conventions and custom extension elements. Activities are represented
      using atom:entry elements but may exist in one of two forms, an Activity
      Entry or an Object Entry.</t>

      <section anchor="activityasentry"
               title="Activity represented as atom:entry">
        <t>Any valid Atom entry as defined by section 4.1.2 of <xref
        target="RFC4287"></xref> is a representation of one or more activities
        as defined in <xref target="activity"></xref>.</t>

        <t>If the atom:entry contains at least one activity:verb element and
        at least one activity:object element then it is a full activity entry
        and MUST be processed as described in <xref
        target="fullactivityentry"></xref>. Otherwise the entry is an implied
        activity shorthand entry and MUST be processed as described in <xref
        target="impliedactivityentry"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Although there is not a one-to-one mapping between an Atom entry
        and an activity, consumers SHOULD retain the value of the atom:id
        element from which each activity was produced such that these
        activities can be identified should an entry be referred to by another
        Atom feature which is not aware of the extensions defined in this
        specification. This id is not unique across all activities and has no
        semantic significance for Activity Streams processing.</t>

        <section anchor="fullactivityentry" title="Full Activity Entry">
          <t>A full activity entry represents a selection of one or more
          activities which refer to different objects but all share the same
          values for the other activity properties.</t>

          <t>The atom:author element which applies to the entry, as defined by
          section 4.2.1 of <xref target="RFC4287"></xref>, represents the
          actor of the represented activities. This element MUST be processed
          into an object construct as defined in <xref
          target="object-as-author"></xref>.</t>

          <t>If the entry element has as a direct child an activity:target
          element then this element represents the target of the represented
          activities. This element MUST be processed into an object construct
          as defined in <xref target="object-as-object"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The atom:published child element of the entry, as defined in
          section 4.2.9 of <xref target="RFC4287"></xref>, represents the time
          of the represented activities.</t>

          <t>Each activity:verb child element of the entry represents a verb
          for the represented activities.</t>

          <t>If the entry has as a direct child an atom:generator element then
          it MUST be processed as defined in section 4.2.4 of <xref
          target="RFC4287"></xref> and its name and URI used for the generator
          property of the represented activities.</t>

          <t>Each activity:object child element of the entry represents the
          object of an activity whose other properties are represented as
          described above. Each element MUST be processed into an object
          construct as defined in <xref target="object-as-object"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The set of activities represented by a full activity entry is the
          set of activities created by combining the object represented by
          each activity:object element with the other common properties.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="impliedactivityentry"
                 title="Implied Activity Shorthand">
          <t>An implied activity shorthand entry represents exactly one
          activity in terms of its object.</t>

          <t>The atom:published child element of the entry, as defined in
          section 4.2.9 of <xref target="RFC4287"></xref>, represents the time
          of the represented activity.</t>

          <t>If the entry has as direct children one or more activity:verb
          elements, each of these elements represents a verb for the
          represented activity. If the entry has no activity:verb child
          elements, the represented activity is implied to have only the
          "post" verb as defined in [<spanx style="strong">TODO:</spanx> write
          this section and xref].</t>

          <t>If the entry has as a direct child an atom:generator element then
          it MUST be processed as defined in section 4.2.4 of <xref
          target="RFC4287"></xref> and its name and URI used for the generator
          property of the represented activity.</t>

          <t>If the set of verbs for the represented activity includes the
          "post" verb, the atom:author element which applies to the entry, as
          defined by section 4.2.1 of <xref target="RFC4287"></xref>,
          represents the actor of the represented activity. If the set of
          verbs does not include the "post" verb then the containing atom:feed
          element MUST have an atom:author element as its direct child and
          this element represents the actor of the represented activity. This
          appropriate atom:author element MUST be processed into an object
          construct as defined in <xref target="object-as-author"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The atom:entry element itself MUST also be processed into an
          object construct as defined in <xref
          target="object-as-entry"></xref> and used as the object of the
          represented activity. If the set of verbs for the represented
          activity does not include the "post" verb then the atom:published
          child element MUST be ignored when doing this processing, because
          the date therein represents the date of the activity and not the
          publication date of the object.</t>

          <t>The represented activity of an implied activity shorthand entry
          does not have a target.</t>

    <section anchor="rss2representation" title="RSS 2.0 Representation">
      <t>Activities can be represented in an RSS 2.0.11 document, as defined
      by <xref target="RSS2"></xref>, using a combination of conventions and
      custom extension elements. An activity is represented using an RSS
      "item" element. The RSS serialization only supports a subset of the
      activity data model allowing descriptions of simple activities that have
      only a verb and an object. This serialization is optimized for posting
      activities describing the creation of new objects. Publishers with a
      need for representing other fields that are not catered for by this
      serialization are recommended to use the Atom serialization instead for
      best results. This RSS serialization is defined only as a means for
      those already publishing streams of objects as RSS to produce minimally
      useful list of activities for activity-aware consumers.</t>

      <t>A specific RSS document has a single activity actor that applies to
      all activities it represents. This actor has no known id, name, url or
      object type but it is assumed that all activities in the feed share the
      same actor and therefore consumers MAY use information obtained from
      another source, such as the user account which is assumed to be the
      subject of the feed, to populate these properties.</t>

      <section title="Activity Represented as RSS &quot;item&quot;">
        <t>In this section, "the item" refers to the RSS "item" element which
        is representing the activity.</t>

        <t>An RSS "item" element represents exactly one activity in terms of
        its object.</t>

        <t>The first pubDate child element of the item, as defined in <xref
        target="RSS2"></xref>, represents the time of the represented
        activity.</t>

        <t>If the item has as direct children one or more activity:verb
        elements, each of these elements represents a verb for the represented
        activity. If the entry has no activity:verb child elements, the
        represented activity is implied to have only the "post" verb as
        defined in [TODO: write this section and xref].</t>

        <t>The author of the activity is the feed-wide actor as described in
        <xref target="rss2representation"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The first title child element of the item, as defined in <xref
        target="RSS2"></xref>, represents the title of the activity's
        object.</t>

        <t>If and only if the set of verbs for the activity includes the
        "post" verb, the first pubDate child element of the item, as defined
        in <xref target="RSS2"></xref>, also represents the publication time
        of the activity's object.</t>

        <t>The first link child element of the item, as defined in <xref
        target="RSS2"></xref>, represents the URL of the activity's object. If
        no such element is present, the first guid child element which is
        marked as a permalink, as defined in <xref target="RSS2"></xref>,
        represents the URL of the activity's object.</t>

        <t>The first guid child element of the item, as defined in <xref
        target="RSS2"></xref>, represents the id of the activity's object if
        and only if its value conforms to the syntax for an IRI as defined in
        <xref target="RFC3987"></xref>. If it does not conform to this syntax,
        the activity's object has no id.</t>

        <t>The activity represented by the item has no target.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>As this specification defines an extension to the Atom Syndication
      Format, it is subject to the same security considerations defined in
      <xref target="RFC4287"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Publishers or Consumers implementing Activity Streams as a stream of
      public data may also want to consider the potential for unsolicited
      commercial or malicious content and should take preventative measures to
      recognize such content and either identify it or not include it in their
      stream implementations.</t>

      <t>Publishers should take reasonable measures to make sure potentially
      malicious user input such as cross-site scripting attacks are not
      included in the Activity Streams data they publish.</t>

      <t>Consumers that re-emit ingested content to end-users MUST take
      reasonable measures if emitting ingested content to make sure
      potentially malicious ingested input is not re-emitted.</t>

      <t>Consumers that re-emit ingested content for crawling by search
      engines should take reasonable measures to limit any use of their site
      as a Search Engine Optimization loophole. This may include converting
      un-trusted hyperlinks to text or including a rel="nofollow"
      attribute.</t>
