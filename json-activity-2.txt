                    Draft: JSON Activity Streams 2.0

Abstract

   This specification details a model for representing potential and
   completed activities using the JSON format.

Author's Note

   This draft is heavily influenced by the original JSON Activity
   Streams 1.0 specification that was originally co-authored by Martin
   Atkins, Will Norris, Chris Messina, Monica Wilkinson, Rob Dolin and
   James Snell.  The author is very thankful for their significant
   contributions and gladly stands on their shoulders.

1.  Introduction

   In the most basic sense, an "activity" is a semantic description of
   either a potential or completed action.  In the former case,
   activities express what can be done with any particular object, while
   in the latter case, they express what has already been done.

   It is the goal of this specification to provide a JSON-based syntax
   that is sufficient to express metadata about activities in a rich,
   human-friendly, machine-processable and extensible manner.  This may
   include constructing natural-language descriptions about the
   activity, visual representations about he activity, associating
   actionable information with various types of objects, communicating
   or recording activity logs, or delegation of potential actions to
   other applications.

1.1.  Relationship to JSON Activity Streams 1.0

   The JSON Activity Streams 1.0 specification was published in May of
   2011 and provided a baseline extensible syntax for the expression of
   completed activities.  This specification builds upon that initial
   foundation by incorporating lessons learned through extensive
   implementation, community feedback and related work being performed
   in other standards development communities.

   While the syntax defined by this specification diverges somewhat from
   that defined by JSON Activity Streams 1.0, the verbs, objectTypes,
   extensions and fundamental model defined by that original
   specification remain intact.

1.2.  Relationship to JSON-LD 1.0

   The JSON-based Serialization for Linked Data (JSON-LD) describes a
   rich syntax for the serialization of semantically-rich metadata using
   the JSON format.  While the updated Activity Streams representation
   defined in this document is not defined as a "JSON-LD Vocabulary",
   the syntax is designed to be closely compatible with JSON-LD such
   that implementations can utilize both with minimal conflict or
   confusion.

   Most significantly, the JSON Activity Streams 2.0 syntax uses the
   "@id" and "@type" properties defined by JSON-LD.

   There are a few differences between JSON-LD and the serialization
   syntax described here, specifically:

   o  While JSON-LD allows using relative IRI references in the values
      of @id properties, this specification limits @id properties to



Snell                                                           [Page 3]

      absolute IRIs.

   o  While it is possible to derive a JSON-LD "context" description for
      the Activity Streams 2.0 JSON syntax one is not normatively
      provided.

1.3.  Notational Conventions

   The text of this specification provides the sole definition of
   conformance.  Examples in this specification are non-normative.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.4.  Syntax Conventions

   This specification defines a JSON-based [RFC4627] serialization
   syntax.

   When serialized, absent properties MAY be represented either by
   setting the property whose value to null or by omitting the property
   declaration altogether at the option of the publisher; these two
   representations are semantically equivalent.  If a property has an
   array value, the absence of any items in that array MUST be
   represented by omitting the property entirely or by setting the value
   to null.

   This specification uses IRIs [RFC3987].  Every URI [RFC3986] is also
   an IRI, so a URI may be used wherever below an IRI is named.  There
   are two special considerations: (1) when an IRI that is not also a
   URI is given for dereferencing, it MUST be mapped to a URI using the
   steps in Section 3.1 of [RFC3987] and (2) when an IRI is serving as
   an "id" value, it MUST NOT be so mapped.

   Unless otherwise specified, all properties with date and time values
   MUST conform to the "date-time" production in [RFC3339], with an
   uppercase "T" character used to separate date and time, and an
   uppercase "Z" character in the absence of a numeric time zone offset.
   All such timestamps SHOULD be represented relative to Coordinated
   Universal Time (UTC).


2.  Example Activities

   Following is a simple example of an activity:

         "url": "http://example.org/blog/"
       }
     }

   A more extensive, single-entry "Activity Stream" follows.  In
   addition to containing a number of required and optional core
   properties, the example contains the additional, undefined extension
   properties "foo" and "foo2" for illustrative purposes only.

3.  Object Model

3.1.  Object

   The following "core properties" apply to all JSON objects serialized
   within an Activity Stream document.

   +-----------+---------------+---------------------------------------+
   | Property  | Value         | Description                           |
   +-----------+---------------+---------------------------------------+
   | @id       | IRI           | Provides a permanent, universally     |
   |           |               | unique identifier for the object in   |
   |           |               | the form of an absolute IRI           |
   |           |               | [RFC3987].  Objects SHOULD contain a  |
   |           |               | single "@id" property.  If an object  |
   |           |               | does not contain an "id" property,    |
   |           |               | consumers MAY use the value of the    |
   |           |               | "url" property as a less-reliable,    |
   |           |               | non-unique identifier.                |
   | @type     | IRI           | Identifies the type of object.  An    |
   |           |               | object MAY contain a "@type" property |
   |           |               | whose value matches either the        |
   |           |               | "isegment-nz-nc" or the "IRI"         |
   |           |               | production in [RFC3987].  The use of  |
   |           |               | a relative references other than a    |
   |           |               | simple name is not allowed.  If no    |
   |           |               | "@type" property is specified, the    |
   |           |               | object has no specific type.          |
   | name      | String        | A natural-language, human-readable,   |
   |           |               | plain-text name for the object.  HTML |
   |           |               | markup MUST NOT be included.  An      |
   |           |               | object MAY contain a "name" property. |
   |           |               | If the object does not specify a      |
   |           |               | "@type" property, the object SHOULD   |
   |           |               | specify a "name".                     |
   | url       | Link          | A Link (Section 3.3) value describing |
   |           |               | a resource that provides a visual     |
   |           |               | representation of the object.  An     |
   |           |               | object MAY contain a "url" property.  |
   +-----------+---------------+---------------------------------------+

3.2.  Additional Object Properties

   The following "additional properties" MAY be used with any JSON
   Object serialized within an Activity Stream document.

   |               |               | SHOULD contain a "duplicate"      |
   |               |               | property when there are known     |

3.3.  Link Values

   Link values represent references to other objects and resources.
   They are expressed as either: (1) a String containing an absolute or
   relative IRI, (2) an Object (Section 3.1), or (3) a JSON Array
   containing a mixture of IRIs or Objects (Section 3.1).  Link values
   are closely related to the conceptual model of Links as established
   in [RFC5988], but have a serialization that is compatible with the
   JSON-serialization for Linked Data.

   For instance, as defined in the previous section, all objects
   (Section 3.1) can contain an "image" property whose value describes a
   graphical representation of the containing object.  This property
   will typically be used to provide the URL to a JPEG, GIF or PNG type
   resource that can be displayed to the user.  Any given object might
   have multiple such visual representations -- multiple screenshots,
   for instance, or the same image at different resolutions.  Based on
   the JSON-LD approach, there are essentially three ways of describing
   these references.

   To reference a single image without any additional metadata, the link
   value can be expressed as a simple JSON string containing an absolute
   or relative IRI:

     {
       "@type": "application",
       "@id": "http://example.org/application/123",
       "name": "My Application",
       "image": "http://example.org/application/123.png"
     }








Snell                                                          [Page 10]

                             ActivityStreams                    May 2013


   Alternatively, if additional metadata is required, the link can be
   expressed as an object that uses the @id or url property:

     {
       "@type": "application",
       "@id": "http://example.org/application/123",
       "name": "My Application",
       "image": {
         "@id": "http://example.org/application/123.png",
         "mediaType": "image/png",
         "height": 320,
         "width": 320
       }
     }

   If more than one link value is to be expressed, A JSON Array with a
   mix of string and object elements can be used:

     {
       "@type": "application",
       "@id": "http://example.org/application/123",
       "name": "My Application",
       "image": [
         "http://example.org/application/abc.gif",
         {
           "@id": "http://example.org/application/123.png",
           "mediaType": "image/png",
           "height": 320,
           "width": 320
         }
       ]
     }

   Individual items contained in such an array value are independent of
   the others and no significance is given to the order of items in the
   array.

   RFC 5988 defines that all Links have a conceptual "link relation"
   that describes the contextual purpose of the link.  Within an
   Activity Streams document, in the absence of a specific "rel"
   property within the link, the name of the property whose value is a
   link serves as the "link relation".  Any legal link relation value,
   as defined by RFC 5988, can be used as a property with a link value
   in any Activity Streams object, except where the link relation might
   conflict with any other property defined by this specification.

   When represented as an object (Section 3.1), Link values may contain
   any of the following additional properties:

3.4.  Activity

   Activity objects are specializations of the base Object (Section 3.1)
   type that provide metadata about potential or completed actions.

   Within an Activity object, the "@type" property is used to identify
   the type of activity.  Formerly, in JSON Activity Streams version
   1.0, this was represented using the "verb" property.  All existing
   verb definitions used in JSON Activity Streams 1.0 implementations
   can continue to be used as values of the "@type" property and retain
   their existing semantics.

   | Property   | Value         | Description                          |

   | "actor"    | Link          | Describes the entity that either     |
   |            | (Section 3.3) | peformed or is expected to perform   |
   |            | value         | the Activity.                        |
   | "object"   | Link          | Describes the primary object of the  |
   |            | (Section 3.3) | activity.  For instance, in the      |
   |            | value         | activity, "John saved a movie to his |
   |            |               | wishlist", the object of the         |
   |            |               | activity is "movie".  An activity    |
   |            |               | SHOULD contain an "object" property. |
   |            |               | If the "object" property is not      |
   |            |               | contained, the primary object of the |
   |            |               | activity MAY be implied by context.  |
   | "target"   | Link          | Describes the target of the          |
   |            | (Section 3.3) | activity.  The precise meaning of    |
   |            | value         | the activity's target is dependent   |
   |            |               | on the activities "verb", but will   |
   |            |               | often be the object the English      |
   |            |               | preposition "to".  For instance, in  |
   |            |               | the activity, "John saved a movie to |
   |            |               | his wishlist", the target of the     |
   |            |               | activity is "wishlist".  The         |
   |            |               | activity target MUST NOT be used to  |
   |            |               | identity an indirect object that is  |
   |            |               | not a target of the activity.        |
   | "result"   | Link          | Describes the result of the          |
   |            | (Section 3.3) | activity.  For instance, if a        |
   |            | value         | particular action results in the     |
   |            |               | creation of a new resource, the      |
   |            |               | "result" property can be used to     |
   |            |               | describe that new resource.          |
   | "context"  | Link          | The "context" property allows the    |
   |            | (Section 3.3) | Activity to further include          |
   |            | value         | information about why a particular   |
   |            |               | action occurred by providing details |

   |            |               | particular action was performed.     |

   |            |               | property is omitted, or expicitly    |
   |            |               | set to null, the assumption is that  |
   |            |               | no explicit priority or importance   |
   |            |               | can be assumed.  All other values    |
   |            |               | falling between 0.00 and 1.00        |
   |            |               | indicate increasing priority.        |

3.4.1.  Considerations on the use of "priority"

   The presence of the "priority" property does not impose any specific
   processing or display requirements on the part of any entity
   consuming the activity.

   Expressing the value as a range of numeric decimal values is intended
   to provide the greatest level of flexibility in the expression and
   consumption of prioritization detail.  It is expected that
   implementors consuming activity objects containing "priority" will
   utilize and expose the additional information in a number of
   different ways depending on the unique requirements of each
   application use case.

   Many existing systems do not typically represent priority values as
   numeric ranges.  Such systems typically use fixed, labeled brackets
   such as "low", "normal" and "high" or "urgent".  Similar mechanisms
   can be established, by convention, when using the "priority"
   property.  In typical use, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations
   wishing to work with such defined categories treat "priority"
   property values in the range 0.00 to 0.25 as "low" priority; values
   greater than 0.25 to 0.75 as "normal" priority; and values greater
   than 0.75 to 1.00 as "high" priority.  Specific implementations are
   free to establish alternative conventions for the grouping of
   priority values with the caveat that such conventions likely will not
   be understood by all implementations.

3.5.  Collection

   Collection objects are a specialization of the base Object
   (Section 3.1) that contain a listing of other objects (Section 3.1)
   The Collection object is used primarily as the root of an Activity
   Streams document as described in Section 4, but can be used as the
   value of object properties.

   Collections have both a logical model and a physical serialization.
   While the logical view of a collection might contain a large number
   of objects, any single serialized representation might include only a
   subset of those objects, with specific Link (Section 3.3) values used
   to reference additional serialized representations that include
   additional subsets.  Such representations are known as "multi-page
   collections", with each serialized subset representing a single
   "page".

   The value of the Collection object's "@type" property MUST be
   "collection" unless the fact that the object is a collection can be
   determined by context.

   Collection objects extend the core object (Section 3.1) definition
   with the following additional properties:

   +----------------+---------------+----------------------------------+
   | Property       | Value         | Description                      |

   | "totalItems"   | Integer       | Non-negative integer specifying  |
   |                |               | the total number of objects      |

   |                |               | the collection.  This number     |
   |                |               | might not reflect the actual     |
   |                |               | number of items serialized       |
   |                |               | within the Collection object     |

   |                |               | and time specified.              |

   |                | date-time     | indicates that the collection    |

4.  The Activity Stream JSON Document

   The above defined JSON serialization can be used to represent
   activities, objects and media links in any context.  This section
   defines one particular use of the above formats to publish a JSON
   document representing a stream of activities.

   Publishers using this format MUST produce a valid JSON document whose
   root value is a Collection (Section 3.5).

   The MIME media type of this document MUST be "application/
   activity+json".


5.  Comparison of Identifier Values

   The values of multiple Object (Section 3.1) and Link (Section 3.3)
   value's "@id" properties can be compared to determine if the objects
   represent duplicate content.  Processors MUST compare these values on
   a character-by-character, case-sensitive basis.  Comparison
   operations MUST be based solely on the IRI character strings and MUST
   NOT rely on dereferencing the IRIs or URIs mapped from them.

   As a consequence, two IRIs that resolve to the same resource but are
   not character-for-character identical will be considered different
   for the purposes of identifier comparison.  In such cases, the
   "duplicates" property can be used to expressly relate such objects to
   one another.


6.  Extensibility

   Processors that encounter unfamiliar properties within any Activity
   Streams object MUST NOT stop processing or signal an error and MUST
   continue processing the items as if those properties were not
   present.


7.  Security Considerations

   Publishers or Consumers implementing Activity Streams as a stream of
   public data may also want to consider the potential for unsolicited
   commercial or malicious content and should take preventative measures
   to recognize such content and either identify it or not include it in
   their implementations.

   Publishers should take reasonable measures to make sure potentially
   malicious user input such as cross-site scripting attacks are not



Snell                                                          [Page 17]

   included in the Activity Streams data they publish.

   Consumers that re-emit ingested content to end-users MUST take
   reasonable measures if emitting ingested content to make sure
   potentially malicious ingested input is not re-emitted.

   Consumers that re-emit ingested content for crawling by search
   engines should take reasonable measures to limit any use of their
   site as a Search Engine Optimization loophole.  This may include
   converting un-trusted hyperlinks to text or including a
   rel="nofollow" attribute.

   Consumers should be aware of the potential for spoofing attacks where
   the attacker publishes activities or objects with falsified property
   values with the intent of injecting malicious content, hiding or
   corrupting legitimate content, or misleading users.

   Activity Streams are JSON Documents and are subject to the same
   security considerations described in [RFC4627].

   Activity Streams implementations handle URIs.  See Section 7 of
   [RFC3986].

   Activity Streams implementations handle IRIs.  See Section 8 of
   [RFC3987].
